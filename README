Polar 2 Garmin

Disclaimer/License etc:
Ok, not going to write any disclaimer or such. If you use this... well, then you're
on your own :) Happy? Ok, carry on.

Aim:
The aim for this project is to read Heart Rate data from my AXN500 Polar watch
provided from the .HRM files that I download from it, and insert that data
into GPX files that I download from my Garmin Colorado 300 so that when I upload
those to http://connect.garmin.com they will properly show the HR data collected :)

That's all for now.
